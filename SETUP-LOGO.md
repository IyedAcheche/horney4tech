# How to Add Your Logo

## Quick Setup (2 steps):

1. **Save your logo image** as `logo.png` in the `Horny4Tech` folder
   - Right-click on your logo image
   - Save it to: `/Users/iyedacheche/Desktop/Horny4Tech/logo.png`

2. **Refresh your browser** - the logo will appear automatically!

## Notes:
- The website is already configured to use `logo.png`
- If you want to use a different filename (like `logo.jpg` or `horney-logo.png`):
  - Update line 18 in `index.html`: change `src="logo.png"` to your filename
  - Update line 76 in `index.html`: change `src="logo.png"` to your filename

That's it! Your actual logo will now appear in:
- The navigation bar (top left)
- The hero section (center, large)
